* exwm-firefox-evil - Evil-mode keys in firefox
=exwm-firefox-evil= makes firefox keys modal and binds them to vi-like keys without using any addons. It does this using =exwm-firefox-core=.

To get link-hints you have to download a link-hint addon to firefox and define a new function to send that key to firefox on call like those in =exwm-firefox-core=.

** Know bugs
Mouse clicks only works in insert state
